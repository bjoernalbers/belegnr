# belegnr â€” Generate sequential, unique document numbers (Belegnummern)

The German Federal Ministry of Finance mandates that every document in the
accounting system must be assigned a *consecutive, unique document number*
a.k.a. "Belegnummer".
`belegnr` is a shell script to create such document numbers.
